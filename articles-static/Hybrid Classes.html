<p>Here are some of the most commonly used hybrid builds. </p>
<h3 id="attacking-hybrid">Attacking hybrid</h3>
<img src="/api/upgrades?build=4848008" />

<p>The Attacking Hybrids main strength is its Player Speed. This means that you can bullet stack incredibly effectively and catch builders off guard more often. It has increased Bullet Range so that you are more likely to get a bounced shot. The increased Player Speed also allows for dodging which means you can leave your area sometimes and get closer to enemies and put them under more pressure to get the kill.</p>
<h3 id="balanced-hybrid">Balanced Hybrid</h3>
<img src="/api/upgrades?build=2738048" />

<p>The Balanced Hybrid is designed so that it can be useful when shooting and reinforcing if needed. The shield allows for reinforcing when there is a weakness in the borders or just a lack of a builder.</p>
<h2 id="upgrade-rules">Upgrade Rules</h2>
<p>When Changing or slightly adjusting your build you should stick to the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use 3-5 Bullet Range.</strong> This is because anymore than 5 means you are wasting upgrade points as you will never need anymore than 5 Bullet Range. Having less than 3 bullet range will mean you are missing out on kills that you could of otherwise had, it could also lead to you becoming too reliant on one style of attacking. The less Bullet Range you have the further forward you have to be to make up for that so if you have too little it will mean you will need to be outside of your area to get kills.</li>
<li><strong>Always use 8 Tower Health.</strong> Less than full tower health can lead to weakness in your frontline and can end up getting builders killed or making it easier to dig through the base. </li>
<li><strong>Bullet Reload must never be below 7.</strong> The more Bullet Reload you have the more damage you can do. </li>
<li><strong>Bullet Speed should never be below 6.</strong> Bullet Speed is important because it means you give your enemy less time to react to what is going your doing. Low Bullet Speed is easy to defend against and should never be below 6.</li>
</ul>
